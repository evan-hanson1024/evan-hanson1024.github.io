                    <h2>Selenium Automated Regression Testing</h2>
                    Used the Selenium framework in Java to develop automated regression tests to be utilized during
                    point releases. I built these programs from the ground up to prevent the need for manual testers
                    to run regression tests before every point release. Several suites were implemented and put to
                    use in point releases now.

                    Implementing light encryption program used to hide sensitive information stored about test user
                    accounts. This information could later be read and decrypted using a similarly designed program.

                    <h2>Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe AI</h2>
                    Designed and built an AI to play the game of numerical tic-tac-toe against a human or another AI.
                    This AI was designed using a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze every possible game state and
                    determine which move would give the AI the most probable chance of winning. Because this AI
                    was designed to play perfectly, it is unable to lose and will only, at worst, draw.

                    <h2>Coin Counter</h2>
                    Designed an efficient program to determine the best way for an automated cashier to make
                    change based on the currencies currently available to the chashier.

                    Created an AI that was able to find the exit to a maze while avoiding obstacles and traps
                    along the way.

                    Exploited flaws in web-based applications to gain access to information an attacker shouldn't
                    have. These exploits demonstrated the importances of ensuring developers create secure code and 
                    to demonstrate how an attacker might try to gain access to information.
